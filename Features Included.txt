Notes:

If you get hit by enough fire balls, you will die, in which case you'll be alerted "Game Over. You should then refresh the page to play again.

If you spawn inside a platform, just refresh the page again and spawn somewhere else.

The blackholes can be rather powerful and will suck you in and then spit you out, so watch out!
